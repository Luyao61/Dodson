                Pretend you are a police officer. You will see several lineups of faces.
                In each lineup, an eyewitness has identified a face as the suspect.
                The chosen face is highlighted in <strong style="color: red;">red</strong>.
                You also will see the eyewitnessâ€™s written expression of certainty about their decision.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                Your task is to translate the written expression onto a numeric confidence scale.
                Before beginning the task, you will be shown an example involving a yellow smiley face
                that was definitely seen before by the eyewitness.
