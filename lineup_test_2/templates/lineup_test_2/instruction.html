                    Pretend you are a police officer. You will see several lineups of faces.
                    In each lineup, an eyewitness has identified a face as the suspect.
                    The chosen face is highlighted in <strong style="color: red;">red</strong>.
                    You also will see the eyewitnessâ€™s written expression of certainty about their decision.

                <p class="lead">
                    Your task is to translate the written expression onto a numeric confidence scale.
                    Before beginning the task, you will be shown an example involving a yellow smiley face
                    that was definitely seen before by the eyewitness.
